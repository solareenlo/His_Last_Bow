Preface
</h3>

The friends of Mr. Sherlock Holmes will be glad to learn that he is
still alive and well, though somewhat crippled by occasional attacks of
rheumatism. He has, for many years, lived in a small farm upon the
Downs five miles from Eastbourne, where his time is divided between
philosophy and agriculture. During this period of rest he has refused
the most princely offers to take up various cases, having determined
that his retirement was a permanent one. The approach of the German war
caused him, however, to lay his remarkable combination of intellectual
and practical activity at the disposal of the Government, with
historical results which are recounted in _His Last Bow_. Several
previous experiences which have lain long in my portfolio have been
added to _His Last Bow_ so as to complete the volume.
